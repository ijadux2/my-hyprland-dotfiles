## Configuration

The main configuration file is located at `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`. You can customize various settings, including:

### Example Configuration

Hereâ€™s a snippet of a sample configuration:

```ini
# Window management
window_gap = 10
floating = [ "firefox", "gnome-terminal" ]

# Appearance
background = #282a36
foreground = #f8f8f2
```

## Keybindings

Keybindings can be customized in the `hyprland.conf` file. Here are some default keybindings:

- `Mod + Enter`: Open terminal
- `Mod + D`: Open application launcher
- `Mod + H`: Move focus left
- `Mod + J`: Move focus down
- `Mod + K`: Move focus up
- `Mod + L`: Move focus right

## Themes

You can customize the look of your Hyprland environment by using themes. Place your theme files in the `~/.config/hypr/themes/` directory and reference them in your `hyprland.conf`.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, consider the following steps:

1. Check the logs for errors:
   ```bash
   journalctl -xe | grep hyprland
   ```

2. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
